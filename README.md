Movie Roulette
==============

Movie Roulette is a simple mobile application that finds and displays information about the most popular movie according to the TMDb.
Release year and genre can be applied as filters. Additional information for each movie can be accessed through IMDb's webpage
by the press of a button.
Each movie can be added to the user's database so it doesn't get suggested again and the next most popular movie can take turn.
